// It does NOT implement the resource store: publishing content + advancing the
// `published` ref is the resource hub (the resource-hub owner, the resource hub the spec = createVersion + setRef).
// C's job is *when* to publish: coalesce rapid author edits into one publish so
// half-written intermediate states never reach members, flush at run boundaries,
// and — on success — let the orchestrator notify online members to pull.
//
// Invariant: notification happens strictly AFTER the adapter's
// publish resolves (content durable, pointer moved), so members are never told to
// pull a version that is not yet durable. The adapter is expected to resolve only
// on durable success (E's atomic write); this scheduler adds the coalescing.
