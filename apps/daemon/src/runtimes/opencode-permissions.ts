/**
 * Pin OpenCode's workspace to the resolved project directory.
 *
 * OpenCode does not treat its process cwd as the project: it walks up to the
 * nearest enclosing git root and adopts THAT as the worktree (verified with
 * `opencode debug scrap`, whose every registered project is a git root). A
 * managed project directory is not a git repository, and a development install
 * keeps the daemon data directory under the repository root — so OpenCode walks
 * past the project and adopts the whole Hi Design checkout.
 *
 * The consequences are all silent: the agent names the repository root as its
 * workspace and writes the deliverable there, the project directory stays
 * empty, `snapshotProjectArtifactsAsync(cwd)` sees nothing, and the Run reports
 * `no_artifact`. `permission.external_directory` cannot catch it either — once
 * the repository is the worktree, writing inside it is an in-project write.
 *
 * Sent unconditionally, matching the BYOK OpenCode definition that already
 * carried this workaround. Gating it on the `--help` capability probe would
 * turn a missing flag back into the silent data-loss bug; an OpenCode build
 * without `--dir` should fail loudly at spawn instead.
